It's summer break! You decide you're going to embrace that entrepeneurial fire inside of you and finally start living the ***✨American dream✨***; you're going to start your own **business**!
 Your mom takes you to Walmart and you spend all of the allowance you've saved up since Christmas and buy a plastic jug,  some lemons, and some sugar. 
You come home and like the **dirty little capitalist** you are, you get to work and soon enough, you serve your first customer. 
It's everything you've ever dreamed of and people can't get enough of your arguably refreshing beverage and you make back all of your money and **more**. However, like anything good in life, it doesn't last for long: enter **Timmy**. Apart from his horrific oddly dragon-shaped birthmarks, Timbifer is also your **arch-nemesis**. He sees your stand and decides to copy your idea, except his lemonade he sells for 5 cents cheaper, stealing pretty much all of your business. You now have three options:<br><br>
- Challenge his alter ego, ***Little Timmy***, to a rap battle
- Commandeer your mum's credit card and buy enough lemons to secure an **exclusive** deal with the local Walmart, just like they taught you in Sunday school
- Sell your lemonade for dirt cheap, hoping to run Timmy out of business, but you also run the risk of accidentally bankrupting yourself<br><br>
All of these options kind of suck, but there is another ***✨️secret✨️*** fourth option: you talk to Timmy, and you both decide to **increase** your prices to 30 cents a glass and reduce the amount of lemon juice and sugar in the lemonade; with no one else to turn to, the consumers just have to deal with your increased prices and lower quality lemonade. Congratulations, you've just started a **cartel**.<br><br>

Now that you and Timmy are working together, you two agree that you'll take Oak Road and Birch Lane, while Timmy takes Spruce Drive and Acacia Avenue. You make a deal with Walmart, and they agree to give you a discount on lemons for buying in bulk. Because of your increased profits, you two begin experimenting more. You begin replacing your old, smelly, plastic cups with ***✨️Eco-friendly Recyclable Compostoble Bio-Degradable Bamboo Paper Glass Reusable Single-Use Cups✨️***. Timmy starts running a loyalty punch card program, and the masses flock, eager to get that one extra glass of lemonade.

With your wagon full of piles of cash, you begin to buy out smaller family-owned lemonade stands. Soon, all of the lemonade stands in Littleville, AL belong to you and Timmy. Now customers don't have to worry about drastic fluctuations in price or quality, because it's all the same! Mrs. Johnson, frustrated with what she sees as an attack on her two greatest loves, lemonade and free market capitalism, begins to squeeze her own lemonade at home, paving the way for a boycott of your lemonade in your neighbourhood. You manage to *convince* Walmart to reduce the amount of lemons it sells to consumers. You lobby town hall to restrict the smaller upstart lemonade competitors, citing health concerns.

The people have had enough. Mrs. Johnson's backyard operation inspires a quiet rebillion. Neighborhood kids start running underground lemonade stands, their counters hidden behind garden hedges and tool sheds. You and Timmy, desperate to maintain control, take drastic measures; school has started up again, so you bribe Mrs. Williams, your school's principal, to only allow your "officially approved" lemonade on school grounds, putting violators in detention. You hire Tommy, the kid who got suspended last year for selling black-market Pokémon cards, to sniff out anyone violating your lemonade monopoly and to "teach them a little lesson". Before long, the once-friendly town of Littleville turns sour. Timmy starts suspecting you of skimming profits, and late-night arguments in his parents' driveway grow louder. The populace have had enough, and take to the streets, demanding to have their constitutional right to squeeze their own lemonade returned. The government of Colbert County institutes a containment zone around Littleville, as people flee the increasingly violent town looking for a better life. One day you realise just how far your profiteering has gone, when Jimothy doesn't invite you to his birthday party, because his family has been forced to seek refuge in neighbouring Russelville after his father was caught with unauthorized third-party lemonade.

You may be wondering what happens next? That, my friend, is up to you.
